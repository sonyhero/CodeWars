/*
There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).
pillars(2, 20, 25) --> 2000;
*/

function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
    return (numPill<2) ? 0 : (numPill-1)*dist*100+(numPill-2)*width;
  }

console.log(pillars(2, 20, 25));
